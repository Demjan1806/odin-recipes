        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Personally, my favorite cuisine is the Greek cuisine. So I <strong>have</strong> to put a Greek recipe in here. This Greek chicken gyros is covered in delicious tzatziki and wrapped in a nice <em>crispy</em> pita.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken thigh fillets</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>3 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>tzatziki</li>
            <li>4 to 6 pita breads</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag and massage to mix. Add the chicken into the ziplock bag and massage to cover all the chicken in the Marinade. Marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably 3 hours, ideally 12 hours and no longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Brush the outdoor grill with oil, then preheat on medium high. Or heat 1 tbsp of oil in a fry pan over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from Marinade. Cook the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through (cooking time depends on size of chicken).</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the grill / fry pan onto a plate. Cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>If your chicken thighs are large, you may need to cut them. Mine were small.</li>
            <li>Get a pita bread or flatbread (preferably warmed) and place it on a piece of parchment (baking) paper (or you could use foil). Place some Salad down the middle of the bread, then top with chicken and Tzatziki.</li>
            <li>Roll the wrap up, enclosing it with the parchment paper. Twist the end with the excess parchment paper to secure it and cut if desired.</li>
            <li>I prefer to lay everything out on a table and let everyone help themselves.</li>
        </ol>
